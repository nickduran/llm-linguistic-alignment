## Working files

- `alignment-GPT-only.ipynb`
- `alignment-BERT-only.ipynb`

`alignment-GPT-only.ipynb` contains code for generating semantic alignment scores using OPENAI's GPT
- Note: you will need to ask Dr. Duran for the API key for running code

`alignment-BERT-only.ipynb` contains code for generating semantic alignment scores using BERT from HuggingFace
- Note: this needs to be worked on and outputs data similar to that of "GPT-only"
